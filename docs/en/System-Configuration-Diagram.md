2. The Next.js application provides the UI and calls the API routes as needed
3. The API routes execute various processes and communicate with external services as needed
4. Vercel KV and Blob Storage are responsible for data persistence
5. Authentication information and temporary data are stored in Vercel KV
6. PDF files and OCR results are stored in Blob Storage

## Security

- All communication is encrypted with HTTPS
- Secure authentication using Google OAuth
- Protects confidential information using environment variable management provided by Vercel

## Scalability
- Can handle increased traffic due to Vercel's automatic scaling feature
- Flexible response to increased data volume is possible with Vercel KV and Blob Storage
